## Installation

Install dependencies

``` .sh-session
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Or install them manually: blosum, tabulate, termcolor

## Usage

Run `python3 main.py` to get usage instructions:

```
USAGE: python3 main.py <SEQ1> <SEQ2> <gap>
```

The two sequences are passed along as the first two arguments, the final one is the gap penalty as a positive number.

The output should look like this:

| Forward step | Backward traversal | Final result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TODO | TODO | TODO |
